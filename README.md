## What's this?
Here, you'll find all the documents needed to print you rvery own 1:10 scale model DUT21 car! How exciting. You better make sure you like screaming when it breaks, cause this isn't perfect in the slightest. Buckle up if you're brave.

## The origin story

Ever since the DUT21 competition season, I've been thinking about making a 3D printable version of our amazing DUT21 car. Yet, me being me and having both not even a 3D printer and piss poor CAD skills , as well as being busy enough already, meant it would stay little more than a wish.

Yet still, as competition season again grew near the urge to have some tangible memory of my car never faded, until one fateful day I decided to splurge and buy a 3D printer. Problem one :white_check_mark: 

However, that still left me with another problem: one does not simply simplify a car with more parts than I can count, most of which smaller than would even show up when printed at a 1:10 scale. I wasn't all that keen on basically redrawing a simplified car from scratch (without e.g. all fasteners), but couldn't get the original car model to print (turns out inserts are annoying: they leave holes everywhere). Probably because to everyone's surprise, this car wasn't designed to be 3D printed but to `win FSG by maximising the downforce-to-weight ratio`.

Anyway, turns out that our lovely aero department had already worked their Catia magic and a simplified model existed for  CFD. Who knew. Problem two :white_check_mark:

Exporting all those as a `.step` file turned out to be a good choice, as you can actually easily edit those in any other software. Some press pulling in Fusion to bulk up some of the flimsy aero and suspension rods later, I'm happy to report I've got something that prints reasonably well, resulting in a bulk of PLA on my desk which is vaguely reminiscent of the actual car. 

## The files
The car is split up into a whole bunch of different prints to fit onto my Ender 3 pro. If you've got a big printer, I dare you to print it all in one go, but if not, splitting it up seems pretty smart, so that print orientations can be chosen to be non-entirely-dumb.

You'll find all the .stl files of the parts in this repo, as well as the fusion model in case you wanna work on that to fix everything I've done wrong.

## Printing
I dunno, but I used standard settings for 0.2mm layer height in Cura, except for lightning infill and tree supports where needed. Sometimes I added a brim to prevent warping. Orientation should be pretty self explanatory except for the chassis: print those with the glue interface down. 

### Specs of mine
- Weight: 212 gram
- LxWxH: 29.4mm/15.9mm/11.9mm
- Printing time: dunno, I guess ~30h?


## Painting
I used spray paint for the chassis and a bit of manual painting with a brush for blue highlights and red brake calipers.
Don't forget a primer and take your time while marking off the chassis. For the blue color of the chassis, I used [RAL 5003 from Bauhaus](https://nl.bauhaus/spuitlak-gekleurd/dupli-color-color-lakspray-ral-5003-saffierblauw/p/15071694), cause that's what they had here in Delft.

## Assembly
Just glue it, but be smart with the order
